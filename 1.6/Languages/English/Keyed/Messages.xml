    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_recorded_over>Through unknown means, the data on {0} has been overwritten with footage of ancient televsion programs!</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_recorded_over>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_not_safely>{0} was not safely ejected last time it was used and the data has been corrupted.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_not_safely>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Fade>A solar flare has destabilised {0}! The knowledge it contained is now lost.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Fade>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Rodents>An ancient virus predating the colony has been discovered on {0}. It has been safely destroyed so the virus cannot spread, however the knowledge is irretrievably lost.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Rodents>

    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_CleanUpSpill>{PAWN_nameDef} spilled {PAWN_possessive} drink near a bookshelf. In {PAWN_possessive} haste, {PAWN_pronoun} used "{0}" to soak up the spill, rendering it unreadable.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_CleanUpSpill>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_TP>{PAWN_nameDef} was caught short. In {PAWN_possessive} haste, {PAWN_pronoun} grabbed "{0}" to wipe with, leaving it a smeared useless mess.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_TP>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_PaperAirplane>{PAWN_nameDef} was making paper airplanes. While not paying attention, {PAWN_pronoun} grabbed "{0}". The plane flew straight out the window and into a dirty puddle, soaking away any ink and leaving it blank and muddy.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_PaperAirplane>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Solidarity>{PAWN_nameDef} was gripped by a sudden fervor for the proletariat. Declaring "{0}" to be a product of bourgeois decadence, {PAWN_pronoun} burned the document in a defiant act of solidarity with the working class.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Solidarity>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_SmokeleafRoll>{PAWN_nameDef} was desperate for a hit of smokeleaf and, lacking proper papers, decided that "{0}" looked like the perfect substitute. {PAWN_pronoun} rolled a massive joint with the research, and the colony's progress went up in a thick, fragrant cloud of smoke.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_SmokeleafRoll>
