    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayLetterLabel>Research Paper Decay</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayLetterLabel>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Damp>Damp has gotten into the knowledge stores and destroyed {0}. Its secrets have been lost to moisture and mold.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Damp>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Insects>An aggressive insect hive has eaten through {0} and its secrets have been lost!</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Insects>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Fade>The ink on {0} has mysteriously faded beyond recognition. The knowledge it contained is now illegible.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Fade>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Rodents>Rodents have nested in the archives and shredded {0} for bedding material. The knowledge is irretrievably lost.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Rodents>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_CleanUpSpill>{PAWN_nameDef} spilled {PAWN_possessive} drink near a bookshelf. In {PAWN_possessive} haste, {PAWN_pronoun} used "{0}" to soak up the spill, rendering it unreadable.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_CleanUpSpill>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_TP>{PAWN_nameDef} was caught short. In {PAWN_possessive} haste, {PAWN_pronoun} grabbed "{0}" to wipe with, leaving it a smeared useless mess.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_TP>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_PaperAirplane>{PAWN_nameDef} was making paper airplanes. While not paying attention, {PAWN_pronoun} grabbed "{0}". The plane flew straight out the window and into a dirty puddle, soaking away any ink and leaving it blank and muddy.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_PaperAirplane>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Solidarity>{PAWN_nameDef} was gripped by a sudden fervor for the proletariat. Declaring "{0}" to be a product of bourgeois decadence, {PAWN_pronoun} burned the document in a defiant act of solidarity with the working class.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_Solidarity>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_SmokeleafRoll>{PAWN_nameDef} was desperate for a hit of smokeleaf and, lacking proper papers, decided that "{0}" looked like the perfect substitute. {PAWN_pronoun} rolled a massive joint with the research, and the colony's progress went up in a thick, fragrant cloud of smoke.</EntropyFlavourPack_DecayMessage_SmokeleafRoll>

    <EntropyFlavourPack_TechRegressionLetterLabel>Tech Regression: {0}</EntropyFlavourPack_TechRegressionLetterLabel>
    <EntropyFlavourPack_TechRegressionLetterText>As knowledge slips away from your colony, a new burden has taken hold:\n\n{0}\n\n{1}\n\nThis penalty will persist as a consequence of your technological regression.</EntropyFlavourPack_TechRegressionLetterText>
